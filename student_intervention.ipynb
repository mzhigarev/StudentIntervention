    "\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    " - Credit scoring is one of the problems where logistic regression could be applied. It's the most trivial example that could be easely found online. Here are just some mentions of LR <a href=http://www.statsoft.com/Textbook/Credit-Scoring>here</a> and <a href=http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~bm508/teaching/retailfinance/Lecture2.pdf>here</a>. \n",
    " - As we know the trained model won't be 100% accurate, so in real life we'll get an error. Basically for business that means we'll get creditors with debts. Banks could sell debt poftfolios (debt cases) to collection agencies. The debt collection agencies are the firms specializing in pursueing payments of debts owed by individuals or businesses. Collection agencies have own call-centers and they contact debtors via phone. There is a chance that the debtor could repay his debt even without court decision. But how likely? We could use logistic regression to estimate that, so we could focus our efforts on those people.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well? \n",
    " - Logistic regression is a simple model that could be trained on datasets of all sizes. The model computational cost fuction is linear that makes it very effecient even for huge datasets. Logistic regression estimates a probability that could be easily tuned based on domain specific knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    " - Variables should be independent. If there are any complex relationships between the data and the target variable the model could not be useful.\n",
    " - Logistic regression could underperform on missing data. \n",
    " - The model is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    " - Logistic regression is a go-to model for many simple classification problems. It's used as a baseline for comparison with other more complex models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    " - <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering>Many spam filters </a>use Naive Bayes for classification whether the incomming email is spam or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well? \n",
    " - Can be trained on few datapoints. Very fast. \n",
    " - According to machine learning practitioners often works great in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    " - The independence assumption. The model is based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of independence between every pair of features. In real life variables could be correlated, e.g. education level may correlate with income, but Naive Bayes assumes that these parameters are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    " - The dataset is small. One of the advantages of NB is it can be trained on few datapoints. \n",
    " - The independence assumption is a very strong dissadvantage here, but I want to make sure that the NB model wouldn't work in practice. There is an opinion that it's not that bad. \n",
    "\n",
